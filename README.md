## ⭐ Overview
**Constellations of Knowing** is an interactive web project that combines **poetry**, **visual art**, and **astronomy** to illustrate how humanity’s understanding of the universe has evolved over more than two thousand years.

Each section features:

- a **4-line poem** summarizing a philosopher’s contribution  
- a **p5.js visualization** animating their cosmological model  
- a **help icon** providing a simple explanation  

The goal is to transform the history of astronomy into a constellation of interconnected ideas—one that is both educational and artistically expressive.

## ⭐ Motivation
In my astronomy course, I was struck by how each major scientific advancement was built upon the ideas of earlier thinkers. Rather than isolated discoveries, the history of astronomy is a long chain of refinement, correction, and reinvention.

I wanted to create a project that **makes that lineage visible**.  
By blending poetry with interactive models, I hope to present astronomy not only as a science, but as a **story of human curiosity** told across centuries.

### 🌌 Interactive Cosmological Models
Each stanza is paired with a p5.js sketch depicting that thinker’s model:

- **Pythagoras** — perfect sphere  
- **Plato & Eudoxus** — concentric circles  
- **Aristotle** — layered physical spheres  
- **Eratosthenes** — geometry of Earth’s radius  
- **Hipparchus** — star catalog  
- **Ptolemy** — epicycles & deferents  
- **Copernicus** — heliocentric system  
- **Tycho** — hybrid geo-heliocentric model  
- **Galileo** — Jupiter’s moons & Venus’ phases
